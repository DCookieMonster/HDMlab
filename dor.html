            <p>My thesis works focuses on building computational tools for helping groups to reach good decisions. I
                have showed that the extent to which groups converge to correct solutions to problems can be linked to
                the computational complexity class of the problem. I demonstrated this relationship in a series of
                online experiments in which hundreds of subjects were asked to solve analytical problems. I showed that
                groups were significantly more likely to converge to correct solutions when the pro

            <p>My educational background and experience reflects my research interests in the computational and social
                sciences. Since the first year of my undergraduate studies I have been working in the Data Science Lab
                at BGU, headed by my advisor <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~gal/" target="_blank">Dr. Kobi
                    Gal</a>. My initial position was a full stack developer and programmer, but my responsibilities and
                research interests have evolved considerably since that time, I am now running my own research program
                in the lab, including programming online experiments on Amazon Turk. I am highly skilled in programming,
                specifically Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP as well as online web development.

                I am currently working with <a href="http://www.dpi.ufv.br/~lelis/" target="_blank">Dr. Levi Leis</a>
                from Federal University of Viçosa on helping planners to solve hard problems. We are going to use
                people’s estimations of cost as a heuristic to facilitate classical planning algorithms.

                We are using the "Floor Tiles" problem as our pilot. This problem with large grid has considered a hard
                problem to solvers, we hope that by using people we will be able to estimate more accurate the states.
